# Codebase Analysis and Refactoring Report

## Issues Identified

### 1. Domain Services Violating DDD Principles

**Problem:** Services exist in the domain layer (`domain/service/`), which violates DDD principles. Domain services should be exceptional cases for business logic that doesn't naturally fit into entities or value objects.

**Found Issues:**
- `OwnershipService`: Static utility methods that duplicate entity behavior
- `SecurityService`: Infrastructure concern (password hashing) in domain layer  
- `OwnerFactory`: Factory with infrastructure dependencies in domain

**Impact:** Violates DDD layering, creates tight coupling, makes testing difficult

### 2. Inheritance Hierarchy Problems

**Problem:** Inconsistent inheritance hierarchy causing compilation errors:
- `Inhabitant` extends `OwnedEntity` but calls methods from `AssignableEntity`
- Method visibility conflicts between parent and child classes

**Found Issues:**
- `Inhabitant.assignToAquarium()` calls `super.assignToAquarium()` but `OwnedEntity` doesn't have this method
- `validateOwnership()` visibility conflicts between `OwnedEntity` and `Inhabitant`

### 3. Base Package Classes Evaluation

**Current Base Classes:**
- `OwnedEntity`: ✅ Good - Encapsulates ownership validation logic
- `AssignableEntity`: ✅ Good - Encapsulates aquarium assignment logic
- `SpeciesValidation`: ❌ Problem - Static utility class, should be in utils package

### 4. Compilation Errors

**Critical Issues:**
- 16 compilation errors preventing build
- Missing methods in inheritance hierarchy
- Access modifier conflicts
- Missing factory methods

### 5. DDD Principle Violations

**Found Violations:**
- Infrastructure services in domain layer
- Static utility methods instead of proper domain services
- Domain entities depending on infrastructure concerns
- Anemic domain model patterns

## Proposed Solutions

### Phase 1: Fix Inheritance Hierarchy
1. Create proper multiple inheritance pattern
2. Fix method visibility issues
3. Resolve compilation errors

### Phase 2: Remove Domain Services
1. Move `SecurityService` to infrastructure layer
2. Integrate `OwnershipService` functionality into entities
3. Move `OwnerFactory` to application layer

### Phase 3: Restructure Base Classes
1. Keep `OwnedEntity` and `AssignableEntity`
2. Move `SpeciesValidation` to utils package
3. Create proper entity composition

### Phase 4: Enhance Domain Model
1. Add missing factory methods to entities
2. Implement proper domain behavior in entities
3. Remove static utility anti-patterns

## Implementation Plan

The refactoring will be done systematically to maintain functionality while improving architecture.
